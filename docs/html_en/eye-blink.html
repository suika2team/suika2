<h1>Eye Blinking</h1>

<p>
  An eye blinking image must be stored in the "eye" folder that is located in the same folder as the main character image exists.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>happy.png (main character file)</li>
  <li>eye
    <ul>
      <li>happy.png (eye blinking file)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  An eye blinking image consists of image(s) of eye blinking difference(s).
  A frame must be as the same size as the main character image is.
  Frames must be stored horizontally in the left to right order.
</p>
<p>
  Alpha values on borders must be smoothed.
  Please use "Blur Selected" and "Delete" in an image editing software.
</p>
<p>
  The eye blinking interval may be specified in the <code>project.txt</code> file.
  Intervals are slightly randomized, and sometimes double-blinkings are occured.
</p>
<pre><code>#
# Eye blinking interval (seconds)
#
character.eyeblink.interval=4.0

#
# Eye blining frame length (seconds per frame)
#
character.eyeblink.frame=0.15</code></pre>
