OpenNovel
=========
OpenNovel is a tool to create visual novels for both Smartphones and Desktop platforms.

We natively support iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Wasm,
without any compatibility framework such as Unity, SDL or Python.
Our core engine is written in pure ANSI C, making it **the most portable visual novel engine ever**.
We use a few native languages as glue code, such as Swift, Objective-C, Java, C++ and C#.
Take a look at the source code and you will marvel at our flawless porting.

There is no dedicated forum other than GitHub, so please feel free to write to Issues.
We can speak in Japanese and English.
