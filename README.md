## Portability
Take a look at the source code and you will marvel at our flawless porting.

We **natively** support all of the Mobile and Desktop platforms.
"Natively" means we don't use any annoying compatibility layer such as Unity, SDL or Python.

We are undoubtedly the world's greatest visual novel porter.
Our core engine is written in ANSI C, making it **the most portable visual novel engine ever**.

## Advanced GUI Editor
OpenNovel has an easy-to-use IDE app. There are three benefits to use it.

* You can write and edit story scripts by using GUI.
* You can export your game to a target platform by a mouse click.
* You can play back your changes to story on-the-fly.

The editor in the IDE is not perfect, so please consider using your favorite editor with the IDE.
Even if you use an other editor mainly, you can receive benefits from the IDE by using it supplimentary.

## Ditch the Web for Apps
Let me tell you the truth, the Web is old fashion.
If you notice that, move onto Apps!
