Suika2 - An OpenNovel.org Engine
================================

Suika2 is a very portable and mobile-friendly visual novel engine with
an integrated GUI editor.

This project is a fork from the original Suika2 Visual Novel Engine
and [Polaris Engine](https://github.com/polaris-engine-foundation/polaris-engine).

## Portability

Our core engine is written in ANSI C and it's all native.  We port a
thin "Hardware Abstraction Layer" for each platform in a native
language, instead of using a thirdparty framework or a scripting
language.

## Integrated Development Environment

Suika2 has an easy-to-use IDE. There are three benefits to use it.

* GUI edit
* One-click export
* On-the-fly playback

The editor in the IDE is not perfect, so please consider using your
favorite editor with the IDE.  Even if you use an other editor mainly,
you can receive benefits from the IDE by using it supplimentary.

## Developers

The current developers are Maiku and Tenshi.  Maiku is from Japan, and
Tenshi is from Taiwan.
