<h1>Comparison With Other Game Engines</h1>

<h2>What are the features of OpenNovel?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>OpenNovel is one of the leading novel engines for iOS and Android;</li>
  <li>On smartphones, OpenNovel does not employ Unity or other third-party engines;</li>
  <li>OpenNovel provides a Unity version to enable home game console porting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Is it possible to switch to OpenNovel from other engines?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Switching works best if one plans to make creations for iOS and Android only.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where can works made with OpenNovel be published?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Windows / Web browsers
  <ul>
    <li>For beginners, OpenNovel recommends “<a href="https://freem.ne.jp/change_language/change/en" target="_blank">Freem!</a>”;</li>
    <li>For advanced users, OpenNovel recommends publishing on “<a href="https://store.steampowered.com" target="_blank">Steam</a>” (Windows) and “<a href="https://itch.io" target="_blank">itch.io</a>” (Web browsers);</li>
    <li>If a submitted project does not break any website rules, it should be eagerly accepted there.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>iPhone / iPad / Vision Pro
    <ul>
      <li>1. One may install an app on an Apple ID device (through Apple Development);</li>
      <li>2. If a device ID is registered in advance, one may install an app with AirDrop for up to 100 devices (through Ad Hoc);</li>
      <li>3. App Store publishing requires a comprehensive review of app contents by Apple (through App Store Connect).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Android
    <ul>
      <li>An APK file may be uploaded to a suitable location (such as Google Drive) as an independent app;</li>
      <li>It takes confirmations of many app testers to release one’s app on Google Play Store.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Home game consoles
    <ul>
      <li>Register as a developer on game console websites and submit your work;</li>
      <li>When filling out an application, specify “Unity” in the required “Middleware” and “Game Engine” fields;
</li>
      <li>Obtain a Unity release made for game consoles.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Can features of other engines be implemented in OpenNovel?</h2>
<p>
  That depends: For example, PCs are usually a hundred times more powerful than smartphones, thus, certain features must not be implemented in consideration of software porting.
</p>

<h1>Installation Issues</h1>

<h2>The downloaded OpenNovel release does not run!</h2>
<ul>
  <li>It may be that antivirus software has mistakenly identified OpenNovel as a virus.</li>
  <li>Solutions:
    <ul>
      <li>Do Windows update;</li>
      <li>Update virus definition files;</li>
      <li>Temporarily disable virus scanning;</li>
      <li>Examine antivirus quarantined files and unmark OpenNovel;</li>
      <li>Download OpenNovel to a different folder;</li>
      <li>Install OpenNovel from a different folder;</li>
      <li>Change the location of OpenNovel projects.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1>Creating Works With OpenNovel</h1>

<h2>Can multiple characters be displayed on a screen?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>That can be achieved through OpenNovel rendering system called <a href="ciel.html">Ciel</a> (similar to YU-RIS/ERIS engine);</li>
  <li>For those who find Ciel too complicated, <a href="reference.html#chch"><code>@chch</code></a>  command should be used instead.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Can a message box stay displayed while a character is changed?</h2>
<p>
  Change =0 to =1 in the project.txt file (as in the following example): 
</p>
<pre><code>msgbox.show.on.ch=1</code></pre>

<h2>Can a character’s face be displayed next to a message box?</h2>
<p>
  An image of a character can be displayed at a special position via <code>face</code> instruction. Note that fade-in&nbsp;/&nbsp;fade-out time specifications are ignored for such images.
</p>
<pre><code>@ch face filename.png</code></pre>

<h2>Can facial expression changes be done using only face parts?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>For smartphones, such changes&nbsp;— considering loading time, memory use, and composing time&nbsp;— may be impracticable, therefore, these features have not been implemented.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Resolving font change issues:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A font file name is recorded in the saved data, which may cause problems (such as not being able to change the font, or being told that a font file&nbsp;— that should not have been specified&nbsp;— cannot be opened).</li>
  <li>This issue can be solved by closing the program, deleting “<code>save</code>” folder (saved data), and restarting the program.  </li>
</ul>

<h2>What are the steps to create a title screen?</h2>
<p>
  Please refer to “<a href="menu.html">How to Make a Menu Screen</a>” for the instructions.

  <li>Cheap Android smartphones incapable of good image rendering are not recommended;</li>

</ul>

<h2>Does OpenNovel has a macro function?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Yes, there is <a href="reference.html#gosub"><code>@gosub</code></a> command available.</li>
  <li>Apply <a href="reference.html#using"><code>using</code></a> instruction to place macros into an external file.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Does OpenNovel support CG viewing mode?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Yes, using <a href="reference.html#menu"><code>@menu</code></a> command.</li>
  <li>Specify in the button configuration&nbsp;— <code>type: gallery;</code> and variable (for example)&nbsp;— <code>var: $1;</code></li>
  <li>If variable is 0, the button is not displayed;</li>
  <li>If variable is not 0, the button is displayed.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h2>What bit rate should be used for audio files?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>For PCs:
    <ul>
      <li>BGM&nbsp;— Stereo 128&nbsp;Kbps;</li>
      <li>SE&nbsp;— Stereo 128&nbsp;Kbps;</li>
      <li>Voice&nbsp;— Mono 64&nbsp;Kbps;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For smartphones:
    <ul>
      <li>All Mono&nbsp;— 48&nbsp;Kbps;</li>
      <li>Mono because there is usually only one speaker;</li>
      <li>Stereo quality is inconsiderable for small speakers of smartphones, therefore, low bit rates are recommended to reduce one’s distribution size;</li>
      <li>However, if earphones are to be used, the same settings as for PCs may be recommended so that one’s playback is unaffected. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>How to manage flags properly?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Please name flags in your configuration file and comment on their purpose;</li>
  <li>Over time, good project maintenance depends on that;</li>
  <li>Comments should be phrased in such a way that they can be easily read and understood even a year later.</li>
</ul>
